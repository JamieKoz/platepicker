## PlatePicker

PlatePicker is a web app that helps you decide your next meal ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs something from your own recipe list or a local restaurant.

Instead of endlessly scrolling menus or cookbooks, PlatePicker shows you two choices at a time. You pick your favorite, and it repeats until a single winner emerges.
